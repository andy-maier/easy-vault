    Get the password for a vault file from the keyring service and if not found
    there, by interactively prompting for it.

    The use of the keyring service and the use of password prompting can be
    individually disabled, but at least one of them must be enabled.

    This is a convenience function that uses the password methods of the
    :class:`~easy_vault.KeyRingLib` class.

    Parameters:

      filepath (:term:`unicode string`):
        Path name of the vault file. It will be normalized to identify the
        keyring item for the vault file.

      use_keyring (bool):
        Enable the use of the keyring service for getting the password.

      use_prompting (bool):
        Enable the use of password prompting for getting the password.

      verbose (bool):
        Print additional messages about where the password comes from.

      echo (function):
        Print function to be used for the additional messages in verbose mode.

    Returns:
      :term:`unicode string`: Password for the vault file.

    Raises:
      :exc:`keyring:keyring.errors.NoKeyringError`: No keyring service
        available
      :exc:`keyring:keyring.errors.KeyringError`: Base class for errors with
