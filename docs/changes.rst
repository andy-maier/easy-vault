Version 0.6.0
-------------

Released: 2021-04-02

**Incompatible changes:**

* The new optional 'use_prompting' parameter of 'easy_vault.get_password()' was
  not added at the end of the parameter list. This is incompatible for users
  who called the function with positional arguments. (related to issue #20)

* The '--prompt' option of the 'easy-vault encrypt' and 'easy-vault decrypt'
  commands was removed. (related to issue #20)

**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed the issue that an open() call used the 'encoding' argument which
  is not supported on Python 2.7.

* Fixed issues with files on Windows that have CRLF line endings.

**Enhancements:**

* In the 'EasyVault' class, added more user control for the handling of
  passwords: The init method now accepts if the password is not provided and in
  that case is restricted to operate on decrypted vault files.
  The 'easy_vault.get_password()' function got an additional 'use_prompting'
  parameter that can be used to disable the interactive prompting for
  passwords. (issue #20)

* In the 'easy-vault encrypt' and 'easy-vault decrypt' commands, removed the
  '--prompt' option and added options '--set-password' and '--no-keyring' to
  better separate the two concerns of setting a new password and disabling the
  use of the keyring service. (issue #20)

* Docs: Improved the documentation and command messages in many places.

* Added a '--quiet' option to the 'easy-vault encrypt' and 'easy-vault decrypt'
  commands that sil√∂ences the messages except for the password prompt.
  (issue #12)

* In the 'KeyRingLib' class, added methods 'is_available()' and
  'check_available() that return whether the keyring service is available
  or check that it is available. (issue #34)

* Added a new 'easy-vault check-keyring' command that checks whether the
  keyring service is available. (issue #36)

* Test: Improved test coverage. (issue #8)
