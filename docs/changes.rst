==========


Version 0.6.0.dev1
------------------

Released: not yet

**Incompatible changes:**

* The new optional 'use_prompting' parameter of 'easy_vault.get_password()' was
  not added at the end of the parameter list. This is incompatible for users
  who called the function with positional arguments. (related to issue #20)

* The '--prompt' option of the 'easy-vault encrypt' and 'easy-vault decrypt'
  commands was removed. (related to issue #20)

**Deprecations:**

**Bug fixes:**

**Enhancements:**

* In the 'EasyVault' class, added more user control for the handling of
  passwords: The init method now accepts if the password is not provided and in
  that case is restricted to operate on decrypted vault files.
  The 'easy_vault.get_password()' function got an additional 'use_prompting'
  parameter that can be used to disable the interactive prompting for
  passwords. (issue #20)

* In the 'easy-vault encrypt' and 'easy-vault decrypt' commands, removed the
  '--prompt' option and added options '--set-password' and '--no-keyring' to
  better separate the two concerns of setting a new password and disabling the
  use of the keyring service. (issue #20)

* Docs: Improved the documentation and command messages in many places.

* Added a '--quiet' option to the 'easy-vault encrypt' and 'easy-vault decrypt'
  commands that sil√∂ences the messages except for the password prompt.
  (issue #12)

**Cleanup:**

**Known issues:**

* See `list of open issues`_.
